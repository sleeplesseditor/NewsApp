# NewsApp

A news app built using React Native and the News API. The articles are all linked to related news websites.

You will need to sign up for the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to get the necessary API key and create the 'config/keys' file. The app was recreated following an update of the React Native library causing issues with an earlier version.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
